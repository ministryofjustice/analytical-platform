## C4 Model Diagrams

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), is a graphical method for illustrating the structure of software systems. It was developed by Simon Brown with the intention of facilitating clear and concise communication about system architecture. The model employs straightforward diagrams that promote simplicity and can be easily comprehended by both technical and non-technical individuals.

### Level 1 - Context Diagram
This is the highest level of abstraction and provides an overview of the entire system. It shows the system under consideration and its external dependencies, such as users, external systems, and APIs. Frequency in change will be minimal compared to the other levels.

### Level 2 - Container Diagram

This level focuses on the software system's high-level containers, which are typically applications or services. It illustrates the major components of the system and their interactions. Containers can be web servers, databases, desktop applications, mobile apps, etc.

### Level 3 - Component

This level delves deeper into the containers identified in the previous level. It shows the internal components and their interactions within each container. Components can represent classes, modules, services, or other logical units.
