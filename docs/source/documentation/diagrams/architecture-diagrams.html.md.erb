# Data Platform Architectural Diagrams
 
This page documents the technical architecture diagrams that make up the Data Platform. If you would like to contribute please see the [contributing and updating](#contributing-and-updating) guidance at the bottom of this page.
## C4 Model Diagrams

In the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), the four C's represent [context](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram), [containers](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram), [components](https://c4model.com/#ComponentDiagram), and [code](https://c4model.com/#CodeDiagram). These different levels help you tell the right story to the right audience. These diagrams are for people inside and outside of the the Data Platform team and technical and non-technical people.

### Level 1 - Context Diagram
This is the highest level of abstraction and provides an overview of the entire system. It shows the system under consideration and its external dependencies, such as users, external systems, and APIs. Frequency in change is likely minimal compared to other levels.

### Level 2 - Container Diagram

This level focuses on the software system's high-level [containers](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram), which are typically applications or services. It illustrates the major components of the system and their interactions. Web servers, databases, desktop and mobile applications are all examples of containers.

### Level 3 - Component

This level delves deeper into the containers identified in the previous level. It shows the internal components and their interactions within each container. Components can represent classes, modules, services, or other logical units.

####  3.1 Data Product Component - Proposal

This diagram shows the relationships of a Data Product with other components of the Data Platform.

## Contributing and updating

We created these diagrams using the open source tool [Excalidraw](https://docs.excalidraw.com/). We then embedded the diagram source files into the `.png` format, this creates a `filename.excalidraw.png` file.

There are multiple ways you can view and edit Excalidraw files as seen below.

- On the web using [vscode.dev](https://github.dev/ministryofjustice/data-platform/tree/main/docs/diagrams) with the [Excalidraw extenstion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor)
- Using Visual Studio Code with the [Excalidraw extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor)
