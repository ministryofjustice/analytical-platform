## Tools

### Communication

We use Google Meet for team calls, and Slack huddles or Google Meet for pairing or direct calls.

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication.

We have three main Slack channels listed below.

#### #data-platform

The [#data-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BBJR3RPB) channel is the main channel with all members of the Data Platform.

#### #data-platform-core-infrastructure

The [#data-platform-core-infrastructure](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BRGD7KFH) channel is where the Core Infrastructure team have discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-data-platform

The [#ask-data-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04LY2RVCS2) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the services we run
- get advice from the team

#### #data-platform-notifications

The [#data-platform-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04MUAV0QC8) channel is where we direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues. This includes updates to Team Documentation and  [Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](/documentation/adrs/adr-index.html)

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.
