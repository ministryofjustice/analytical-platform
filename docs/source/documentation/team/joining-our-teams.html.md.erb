## Tools

### Communication

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication. This applies to our ceremonies as well, we have these in Huddles in the #data-platform-apps-and-tools channel.

We use Slack huddles for pairing or direct calls and occassionally we use Google Meet.

We have three main Slack channels listed below.

#### #data-platform

The [#data-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BBJR3RPB) channel is the main channel with all members of the Data Platform.

#### #data-platform-apps-and-tools

The [#data-platform-apps-and-tools](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BRGD7KFH) channel is where the Data Platform Apps and Tools team have discussions about anything ranging from:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.

#### #ask-data-platform

The [#ask-data-platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04LY2RVCS2) channel is for anyone who isn't in the team to:

- ask questions about the services we run
- get advice from the team

#### #data-platform-notifications

The [#data-platform-notifications](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04MUAV0QC8) channel is where we direct notifications from GitHub, such as pull requests or issues. This includes updates to Team Documentation and  [Architecture Decision Records (ADR)](/documentation/adrs/adr-index.html)

It's a noisy channel, so it's up to you whether to join it.
