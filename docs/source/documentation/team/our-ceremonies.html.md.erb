# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Our stand-ups run daily at 10:00 and last for fifteen minutes.  We will follow one of two formats:

- **Walk The Board**

    Starting with the "Done" column we discuss any active issues in GitHub Projects (https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/27/views/18).

- **Yesterday, Today, Blocked**

    A round robin of each team member discussing their issues and any blockers.

## Sprint Planning

Each Sprint is two weeks long and starts on a Thursday.
We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/27/views/18) for planning and run a one-hour session. Template agenda below:

1. Discuss the previous sprint and if we met our objective/estimated tickets, did we achieve anything outside of our goal?
1. Review any tickets caring over to the next sprint and why
1. Agree team capacity for the sprint
1. Pull any new issues into the sprint backlog and ensure all tickets have sufficient descriptions, epics assigned and estimated size
1. Any other business.

## Backlog Refinement

On Thursday afternoons we have a forty-five minute session on backlog refinement. The purpose of this ceremony is for the team to agree that any issues created have enough information for any other team member to pick up.  Once a issue is refined we estimate it using the [Fibonacci scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_scale_(agile)).

## Data Platform Show & Tell

Every two weeks we have a [Data Platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BBJR3RPB) thirty-minute show and tell to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint.

Justice Digital template is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tKmNCYiqSqeWSDdF6uG6ifxjbP8rLCH0WpwlMwzea_g/edit#slide=id.g13cb8a0db7d_0_0)

## Sprint Retrospective

At the end of each sprint we have a one-hour retrospective.  This is for the team to openly discuss positives and negatives of the sprint.  The format, using either Miro or Jamboard.
