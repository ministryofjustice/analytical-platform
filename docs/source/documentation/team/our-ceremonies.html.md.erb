# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Our stand-ups run daily at 09:40 and last for fifteen minutes.  We will follow one of two formats:

- **Walk The Board**

    Starting with the "Done" column we discuss any active issues in GitHub via [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/data-platform-core-infrastructure-63e3ab98f777b90011c85bbb/board)

- **Yesterday, Today, Blocked**

    A round robin of each team member discussing their issues and any blockers.

## Sprint Planning 

Each Sprint is two weeks long and starts on a Thursday.
We use Miro or Jamboard to run a one-hour session. Template agenda below:

1. Discuss the previous sprint and if we met our goal, did we achieve anything outside of our goal? (10m).
1. Discuss issues at the top of the backlog and add sticky notes for a potential sprint goal and any risks concerns (10m).
1. Reveal all stickies and vote for your favourite 5 votes (2m).
1. Discuss and finalise any concerns (5m).
1. Pull issues into the sprint.
1. Any other business.

## Backlog Refinement

On Thursday afternoons we have a forty-five minute session on backlog refinement. The purpose of this ceremony is for the team to agree that any issues created have enough information for any other team member to pick up.  Once a issue is refined we estimate it using the [Fibonacci scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_scale_(agile)).

## Backlog Prioritisation

On Monday mornings we have a thirty-minute ceremony for ensuring the top of the 'Backlog' queue is prioritised.  It also stimulates discussion about potenital new issues that should be created before refinement the following week.

## Data Platform Show & Tell

Every two weeks we have a [Data Platform](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04BBJR3RPB) thirty-minute show and tell to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint.

Justice Digital template is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tKmNCYiqSqeWSDdF6uG6ifxjbP8rLCH0WpwlMwzea_g/edit#slide=id.g13cb8a0db7d_0_0)

## Sprint Retrospective

At the end of each sprint we have a one-hour retrospective.  This is for the team to openly discuss positives and negatives of the sprint.  The format, using either Miro or Jamboard.
