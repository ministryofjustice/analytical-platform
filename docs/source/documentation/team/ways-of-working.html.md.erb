## Support

We use PagerDuty to manage our support rota, you can see your upcoming shifts on the [PagerDuty website](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/my-on-call).

Each morning, our PagerDuty Rota app will send a message into the team channel to let us know who is on support that day.

If you are unable to cover your shift, you must find someone to cover for you. If you are unable to find someone to cover for you, you must let the team know as soon as possible.

To add/remove a user from the PagerDuty rota, amend the following files, and submit a pull request:

- [`terraform/pagerduty/users.tf`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform/blob/main/terraform/pagerduty/users.tf)

- [`terraform/pagerduty/teams.tf`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform/blob/main/terraform/pagerduty/teams.tf)

- [`terraform/pagerduty/schedules.tf`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform/blob/main/terraform/pagerduty/schedules.tf)
