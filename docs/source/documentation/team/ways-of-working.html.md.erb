## GitHub

We use GitHub to manage our code and documentation. We use ZenHub to track work and GitHub pull requests to review and merge code.

### GitHub Housekeeping

- When creating a pull request, ensure you have a clear title and description

- If applicable, link your pull request to an issue with the special keywords `closes`, `fixes` or `resolves`

- If your pull request is not ready for review, convert it to a draft

- When your pull request is ready for review, remove the draft status and ensure all checks are passing

- When all checks are passing, use the `/pull` command in Slack to request a review
