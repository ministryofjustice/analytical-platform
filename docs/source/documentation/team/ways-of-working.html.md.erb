## GitHub

We use GitHub to manage our code, documentation and support. We use [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/data-platform-core-infrastructure-63e3ab98f777b90011c85bbb/board) to track work and GitHub pull requests to review and merge code.

### GitHub Housekeeping

- When creating a pull request, ensure you have a clear title and description

- If applicable, link your pull request to an issue with the special keywords such as `closes`, `fixes` or `resolves` [GitHub documentation for linking pull requests to issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)

- If your pull request is not ready for review, convert it to a draft

- When your pull request is ready for review, remove the draft status and ensure all checks are passing

- When all checks are passing, use the `/pull` command in [`#ask-data-platform`](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04VBJTKY58) to request a review

## Support

We use PagerDuty to manage our support rota, you can see your upcoming shifts on the [PagerDuty website](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/my-on-call).

Each morning, our PagerDuty Rota app will send a message into the team channel to let us know who is on support that day.

If you are unable to cover your shift, you must find someone to cover for you. If you are unable to find someone to cover for you, you must let the team know as soon as possible.

### Support Duties
