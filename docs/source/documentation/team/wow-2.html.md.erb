# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Introduction

We are the Data Platform Apps and Tools team (DPAT), a mix of developers and engineers. Our job is twofold: keeping our current [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) running, and developing the future of Data and Analysis within the organisation, [Data Platform](https://technical-documentation.data-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

We work closely with [Data Platform Labs](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/data-platform-data-platform-labs) to build the Data Platform.

We create efficient solutions while learning and improving together. This document lays out how we work to make our collaboration smooth and effective.

## Ceremonies

### Schedule

This team uses **Bi-weekly Sprints:** This is our timeframe for planning, executing, and reviewing work.

The team has the following ceremonies:

| Ceremony                                      | Occurence | Day             | Time          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| [Stand Up](#stand-up)                         | Daily     | Monday - Friday | 10:00 - 10:15 |
| [Backlog Management](#backlog-management)     | Weekly    | Thursday        | 14:00 - 15:00 |
| [Refinement](#refinement)                     | Weekly    | Tuesday         | 11:00 - 12:00 |

### Stand Up

Our stand-ups run daily at 10:00 and last for fifteen minutes. We use [Slack Huddles](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T02DYEB3A/C04M8224WCV) and follow one of two formats:

- **Walk The Board**

Starting with the “Done” column we discuss any active issues on our [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/27/views/18).

- **Yesterday, Today, Blocked**

A round robin of each team member discussing their issues and any blockers.

### Backlog Management

**Purpose:**
Backlog Management is where we ensure our backlog is up to date and ready for refinement. It's where we:

- Prioritise stories - Give a clear picture of what the team is working on, and will be working on next.
- Remove stale stories - Keep the team focused on only relevant work.
- Remove irrelevant stories - Prevent the team's focus from being split with work that's not required.

**Process:**

- TBD in consultation with PM/DM.

**Output:**

- A well prioritised backlog
- A backlog that is ready for refinement and free of stale/irrelevant stories

#### Audience

- Product Manager
- Delivery Manager
- Leadership Team

### Refinement

**Purpose:**
Refinement's our time to get on the same page about what we're tackling next. It's where we ensure everyone has a clear picture of the backlog items before they hit a sprint.

**Prerequisites:**

Prior to engaging in a refinement session, here's what can be prepared:

- **Backlog Familiarisation:** Review the backlog to get a sense of what's coming up, and what's already been done. Read the tickets likely to come up for discussion, so you know what questions you want to ask!
- **Backlog Items:** Ensure any tickets are well fleshed out and ready for discussion. This should include a detailed description of the story, as well as acceptance criteria.
- **Understand Dependencies:** If your tickets rely on other work already being done, know which tickets are required and list them in the body of the issue. This helps us understand correct sequencing of tickets during refinement.
- **Prepare to Communicate!:** Be prepared to articulate why you think a ticket should be done, how big you think it is, and be receptive to teammates, and collaborate to achieve a shared understanding of the tasks at hand. Be open to suggestions on how your ticket could be improved for someone picking it up!

**Process:**

- **Preparation:** Before refinement, the Product Owner picks out the stories that need our attention.
- **Discussion:** Dive into the details of each story, hashing out the acceptance criteria, and spotting any dependencies or risks.
- **Estimation:** Estimate based on effort and risk using a poker-scoring system, allowing the team to have a clear sense of the size and scope of each ticket.
- **Decomposition:** Chop up any stories that are too big to handle in a sprint into smaller bits.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Ensure each story has a clear DoD to know exactly when it is crossed the finish line.

**Output:**

- **Refined Backlog:** Stories that are fleshed out, estimated, and ready for the Product Owner to prioritize.
- **Scored Stories:** Each story gets a score for a straightforward understanding of what we're up against.
- **Tickets Approachable:** All tickets that go through refinement should have all the info required for any member of the team to pick up.

#### Audience

### Sprint Planning

**Purpose:**
Sprint Planning is where we figure out what work we want to commit to for the next sprint. It's where we:

- Discuss and align on the goals for the upcoming sprint
- Select stories from the refined backlog, ensuring a shared understanding of scope and objectives
- Define the sprint goal
- Define the sprint backlog

**Process:**

- **Discussion:** Discuss the stories in the refined backlog, ensuring a shared understanding of scope and objectives, including any work carried from last sprint.
- **Highlighting:** Highlight stories and spikes that are significant to delivery of the sprint goal.
- **Capacity Estimation:** Estimate the capacity of the team for the sprint, and assess whether the tickets brought in match that.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Select the stories that will be brought into the sprint, and assign them to team members where appropriate.

**Output:**

- Ensure everyone has stories that they feel they can work on
- Ensure everyone has a shared understanding of the tasks to deliver this sprint

#### Audience

Entire DPAT team

### Sprint Review

- Review completed work with stakeholders, gathering feedback for future sprints. Usually encorporated with Planning.

#### Audience

At the end of each sprint we have a thirty-minute show and tell showcase to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint. The showcase normally consists of an introduction summing up the sprint and if we met our sprint goal followed by demonstration and then what’s next in the road map

#### Audience

## GitHub Practices

- We utilise GitHub for managing code, documentation, and support, with GitHub Projects for tracking work and GitHub pull requests for reviewing and merging code
- When working in our repos, please adhere to GitHub housekeeping guidelines when creating pull requests, ensuring clear titles and descriptions, linking to issues when applicable, and requesting reviews upon readiness

### GitHub Housekeeping

- When creating a pull request, ensure you have a clear title and description
- If applicable, link your pull request to an issue with the special keywords such as `closes`, `fixes` or `resolves` [GitHub documentation for linking pull requests to issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- If your pull request is not ready for review, convert it to a draft
- When your pull request is ready for review, remove the draft status and ensure all checks are passing
- When all checks are passing, use the `/pull` command in [`#ask-data-platform`](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04VBJTKY58) to request a review

## Development Practices

- This is quite a large topic, so we maintain a separate page for it: [Developing](/documentation/platform/infrastructure/developing.html)

## Support

- Each member of the team is included in the support rota
- Support cover is for one day (10:00-16:30) as allocated by the rota
- If you are unable to cover support please arrange cover
