## Introduction

We are the Data Platform Apps and Tools team (DPAT), a mix of developers and platform engineers. Our job is twofold: keeping our current [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) running.

We work closely with [Data Platform Labs](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/data-platform-data-platform-labs) to build the Data Platform.

We create efficient solutions while learning and improving together. This document lays out how we work to make our collaboration smooth and effective.

### Stand Up

Our stand-ups run daily at 10:00 and last for fifteen minutes. We use [Slack Huddles](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T02DYEB3A/C04M8224WCV) and follow one of two formats:

- **Walk The Board**

Starting with the “Done” column we discuss any active issues on our [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/27/views/18).

- **Yesterday, Today, Blocked**

A round robin of each team member discussing their issues and any blockers.

### Backlog Management

- Prioritise stories
- Remove stale stories
- Remove irrelevant stories

#### Audience

- Product Manager
- Delivery Manager
- Leadership Team

### Refinement

**Purpose:**
Refinement's our time to get on the same page about what we're tackling next. It's where we ensure everyone has a clear picture of the backlog items before they hit a sprint.

**Prerequisites:**

Prior to engaging in a refinement session, here's what can be prepared:

- **Backlog Items:** Compile a list of user stories or tasks believed to be pertinent and ready for discussion, derived from previous sprints, feedback, or team insights.
- **Initial Understanding:** A preliminary understanding of each backlog item, with insights or questions documented beforehand to expedite the process.
- **Attendees:** Ensure the appropriate team members are present, including individuals with specialized knowledge if a story requires it.
- **Preparatory Work:** Have illustrative materials ready to explain backlog items, and understand how each story aligns with the ultimate deliverable for context.
- **Open Communication:** Be prepared to articulate thoughts, be receptive to teammates, and collaborate to achieve a shared understanding of the tasks at hand.

**Process:**

- **Preparation:** Before refinement, the Product Owner picks out the stories that need our attention.
- **Discussion:** Dive into the details of each story, hashing out the acceptance criteria, and spotting any dependencies or risks.
- **Estimation:** Estimate based on effort and risk using a poker-scoring system, allowing the team to have a clear sense of the size and scope of each ticket.
- **Decomposition:** Chop up any stories that are too big to handle in a sprint into smaller bits.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Ensure each story has a clear DoD to know exactly when it is crossed the finish line.

**Output:**

- **Refined Backlog:** Stories that are fleshed out, estimated, and ready for the Product Owner to prioritize.
- **Scored Stories:** Each story gets a score for a straightforward understanding of what we're up against.


- We read the backlog before the session
- Add story details
- Add acceptance criteria
- Find story dependencies
- Find cross cutting stories
- Size stories
- Stories become ready to be picked up

At the end of each sprint we have a thirty-minute show and tell showcase to share with our colleagues and the wider organisation our achievements during the sprint. The showcase normally consists of an introduction summing up the sprint and if we met our sprint goal followed by demonstration and then what’s next in the road map

## GitHub Practices

- Utilise GitHub for managing code, documentation, and support, with GitHub Projects for tracking work and GitHub pull requests for reviewing and merging code
- Adhere to GitHub housekeeping guidelines when creating pull requests, ensuring clear titles and descriptions, linking to issues when applicable, and requesting reviews upon readiness

## GitHub Housekeeping

- When creating a pull request, ensure you have a clear title and description
- If applicable, link your pull request to an issue with the special keywords such as `closes`, `fixes` or `resolves` [GitHub documentation for linking pull requests to issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- If your pull request is not ready for review, convert it to a draft
- When your pull request is ready for review, remove the draft status and ensure all checks are passing
- When all checks are passing, use the `/pull` command in [`#ask-data-platform`](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C04VBJTKY58) to request a review

## Development Practices

- This is quite a large topic, so we maintain a separate page for it: [Developing](/documentation/platform/infrastructure/developing.html)

## Support

- Each member of the team is included in the support rota
- Support cover is for one day (10:00-16:30) as allocated by the rota
- support person is responsible for (do we have a sub list)
- Use PagerDuty to manager our support rota
- Respond to PagerDuty alerts, [support issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues), and review pull requests as part of support duties
- Trial GitHub for managing support issues as of May 2023, encouraging users to utilize issue templates on GitHub for support queries

## Support Duties

### Working hours

A member of the support team will be available online from 10:00 and until 16:30 (Monday-Friday). Any requests outside of these hours will be addressed at best effort of the team.

## Delivery

- **Development:** Implement, test, and document stories, adhering to our Definition of Done
- **Integration:** Collaborate with the other delivery team to ensure smooth integration and alignment on shared goals
- **Deployment:** Follow our deployment checklist for a smooth transition from development to production

## Continuous Improvement
- Actively seek feedback from all team members and stakeholders
- Review and update our Ways of Working as necessary to reflect our evolving process and learnings
