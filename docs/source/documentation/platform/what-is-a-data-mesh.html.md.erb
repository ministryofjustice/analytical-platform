One of the parts of the Data Platform is a Data Mesh.

Data Mesh is an analytical data architecture and operating model where data is
treated as a product and owned by teams that most intimately know and consume
the data.

There are several articles that explore more deeply what a Data Mesh is.
These ones are strongly recommended:

### A Data Mesh

* A mesh is an interlaced structure
* A Data mesh is composed of several Data Products connected
* To be available in the Data mesh, these products have to be good, thoughtful products

### An analogy

In general, a data mesh is like a supermarket:

* Lots of products
* It may have very similar products
* More successful products get more visibility
* You look for what you need
* New products may be available
* Old products may no longer be offered

In a supermarket you see chocolate - not a pile of cocoa with a pile of paper,
and a bottle of water â€“ not a lot of glass or sand
