## Status

🤔 Proposed

## Context

The Data Platform will need a way to verify users and provide access to resources.
We want to simplify user access by reducing the number of identities our users need to manage.
We do not want to run an identity service.

## Decision

We will use AzureAD for Identity and Access Manangment (IDAM).
Our users are already using a `@justice.gov.uk` account as their primary login.
Our users can take advantage of Single Sign On (SSO) to gain access to the Data Platform without the need
for an additional username and password.

## Consequences

- We will not have to run an identity service and managing logging and security of that system
- Reduce our support requirements for joiners, movers and leavers(JML) e.g. issues with multi factor authentication and password resets
- Guest accounts are possible, but not managed which means we will need an alternative solution or existing Auth0 method
- Cross government AzureAD federation is not yet formalised, but in the future we could give other departments access to resources with their existing credentials
