## (How) Does Data Mesh work if we don't/can't own the data? e.g. HMCTS data

Good question, this is my understanding so far:

If HMCTS produces a Data Product A and we want to use it as part of our Data
Product B, then we would connect DPA to DPB. So our DPB would access the data
from DPA and do whatever it needs with it. That could potentially generate a
copy of the data from DPA inside DPB, which I understand as not being
problematic.

## So DPB becomes the internal mirror of DPA? Or does everyone connect to DPA?

DPA would be the source, and everyone that needs that specific Data Product
should connect directly to it. DPB may enrich that data, or combine it with
other data and have a different offering, a different output. It wouldn’t make
 sense to offer a DPB that was a direct mirror of DPA

## What if data producers don't want to support all people who want to use DPA data?

They offer a product to the mesh. The mesh should deal with all the people
wanting to consume that product, making it easy to integrate everything, so
that DPA doesn’t even need to think much about how to share it - maybe being
responsible only about “who should have access to this or not”. If there is
any friction on sharing that data product, then we, the people that make the
mesh viable, should work in making it smarter and remove that friction.

## Is a dashboard part of a Data Mesh?

A dashboard is in the periphery of the mesh, it's an application, an output, it
doesn't mesh with anything, it consumes data from the mesh. It's not exactly
part of the mesh as once information is on it, it can't be shared back to the
mesh. After the dashboard there's a human. Dashboards are products for the
user, of course. They are part of the digital experience. They are not a
product from a data mesh point of view.

## Does the Data Platform support integration with other existing MI systems?

With regards to integration with other existing MI systems, it’s hard to have a
complete statement that they will all work. Each system may need to be analysed.

## Does the Data Platform support integration with other catalogues and other data mesh implementations?

It’s difficult to state that all catalogues will integrate to each other. It is
expected that the catalogue used for the Data Platform will follow an open
standard for sharing information, and therefore other catalogues that follow
similar standards should integrate without difficulty.

## We have external sources that are very messy regular csv dumps - would that
constitute a Data Product?

No. A Data Product is something intentionally shared. It is a combination of
code and data.

The platform is not built to support ad-hoc uploads of manually generated CSVs, etc.
That is by design because at scale, these processes cannot be maintained and
kept up to date. Over time, this leads to data swamps, a deteriorated set of
data that can’t be trusted.

Instead of manually generating CSVs and then attempting to add them to the
platform, make that process internal to a Data Product. That way the extraction
of data, its transformation and potential combination with other sources
becomes reproducible and with a smaller surface for errors.

## Do we provide 'basic' data storage that allows holding data in non-data product format?

No. Similar reason as a previous question: That is by design because at scale,
these processes cannot be maintained and kept up to date. Over time, this leads
to data swamps, a deteriorated set of data that can’t be trusted. There is the
intention to make it easy to create temporary Data Products in order to have
a lower barrier of adoption, and more details can be seen in the section
about dealing with CSVs.

## Can users discover non-data product data (data that's stored but not 'intentionally shared' but not private)?

No. There shouldn’t exist data that is not in a data product.
