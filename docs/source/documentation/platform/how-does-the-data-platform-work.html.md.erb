# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Here are some cross cutting concerns that are relevant to all steps in the platform:

* Audit
* Authentication and Authorisation
* Data Access (who can view/access which data)
* Data Retention
* GDPR
* Monitoring + Alerting
* Observability
* Security (in transit and at rest)
* Support
* Training (documentation and guidance on how to use the platform)
* Vulnerability management

From a different angle, these concerns are the platform.

The data platform should be:

* secure
* self-service

Storage

When it comes to storage itâ€™s good to keep in mind that there are several
different stages in play. The Data Platform is not a place to store all data
from a system. However, that is unlikely to be necessary, as systems usually
have their own data storage solutions. In order to make data available on the
platform, a Data Product needs to be created and a limited storage is
available
