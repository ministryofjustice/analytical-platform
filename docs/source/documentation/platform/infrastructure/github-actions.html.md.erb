# <%= current_page.data.title %>

GitHub Actions is our CI/CD tool of choice. We use it for a variety of tasks such as
building and publishing this documentation,
building and publishing containers and running Terraform

## Style guide

### Structure

* workflow files should be placed in `.github/workflows/`

* workflow files should be named using kebab case, e.g. `build-and-push.yml`

* workflow files should be named relative to what they are doing, e.g. `build-and-push.yml`

## Syntax

* workflow files should start with YAML's [document start marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2760395), `---`

* `name` should be relative to what the workflow is doing, e.g. `name: Build and push`

* `permissions` should default to `read-all` and be overridden if required

* `jobs.<job_id>` should be named relative to what the job is doing, e.g. `jobs.build-and-push`

* `jobs.<job_id>.name` should be relative to what the job is doing, e.g. `Build and push`

* `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].id` should be relative to what the step is doing, e.g. `checkout`

* `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].name` should be relative to what the step is doing, e.g. `Checkout`

* `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].uses` should use the SHA of the release of the action, e.g. `uses: actions/checkout@@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1`

An example of the above can be seen below:

```yaml
---
name: Build and push

on: # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    name: Build and push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
      packages: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1

      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        id: login_ghcr
        uses: docker/login-action@343f7c4344506bcbf9b4de18042ae17996df046d # v3.0.0
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        id: build_and_push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@4a13e500e55cf31b7a5d59a38ab2040ab0f42f56 # v5.1.0
        with:
          context: .
          file: Containerfile
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/data-platform:latest
```
