# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Analytical Platform team offers a managed pipeline for building, scanning and pushing containers to a registry. This is done via GitHub Actions and is available to all teams. This is managed in Terraform.

Images are scanned for vulnerabilities using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), currently with a default severity of `CRITICAL`

Dockerfiles are linted by the Super Linter with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

## Creating a new container image repo

1. To create a new container image repo, clone the [data-platform-github-access](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-github-access) repository.

2. There are two files for creating repositories, one for [Analytical Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-github-access/blob/main/analytical-platform-repositories.tf)
and another for [Data Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-github-access/blob/main/data-platform-repositories.tf). See example below for creating an Analytical Platform container repo.

    ```
    "analytical-platform-<container-name>" = {
          name                = "analytical-platform-<container-name>"
          description         = "Analytical Platform <container-name>"
          use_template        = true
          template_repository = "analytical-platform-image-build-template"
          access = {
            admins = [module.analytical_platform_team.id]
          }
        }
    ```

3. As shown in example above, use the `template_repository = "analytical-platform-image-build-template"` argument.
The template equips you with the default initial files for building a container used in Analytical Platform.
The template repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-image-build-template).

4. Update the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-image-build-template/blob/main/Dockerfile),
[Makefile](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-image-build-template/blob/main/Makefile),
[container-structure-test.yml](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-image-build-template/blob/main/test/container-structure-test.yml)
and any other files as required in your new container repo.

5. There is no longer a requirement for `config.json` or `CHANGELOG.md` files.
