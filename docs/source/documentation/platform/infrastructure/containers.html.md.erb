Data Platform's Core Infrastructure team offer a managed pipeline for building, scanning and pushing containers to a registry. This is done via GitHub Actions and is available to all teams.

Images are scanned for vulnerabilities using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), currently with a default severity of `CRITICAL`

Dockerfiles are linted by the Super Linter with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

## Creating a new container

To create a new container, you will need to:

1. Create a directory in `containers`, e.g. `containers/example-application`

1. Create the configuration file `containers/${CONTAINER_NAME}/config.json` with the following contents

    If you are using DockerHub (public images):

      ```json
      {
        "name": "example-application", # this will be appended to ministryofjustice/data-platform-${name}
        "version": "1.0.0",            # this is the tag that will be applied to the image
        "registry": "dockerhub"
      }
      ```

    If you are using GitHub Container Registry (public images):

      ```json
      {
        "name": "example-application", # this will be appended to ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/data-platform-${name}
        "version": "1.0.0",            # this is the tag that will be applied to the image
        "registry": "ghcr"
      }
      ```

    If you are using Modernisation Platform's AWS ECR (internal images):

      ```json
      {
        "name": "example-application", # this isn't used for ECR, but should be the same as the directory name
        "version": "1.0.0",            # this is the tag that will be applied to the image
        "registry": "ecr",
        "ecr": {
            "role": "arn:aws:iam::013433889002:role/modernisation-platform-oidc-cicd",
            "account": "374269020027",
            "region": "eu-west-2",
            "repository": "data-platform-example-application-ecr-repo" # this is the name of the ECR repository in the Modernisation Platform
        }
      }
      ```

1. Create the CHANGELOG `containers/${CONTAINER_NAME}/CHANGELOG.md` following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format

1. Add your Dockerfile and source code

    If you are using the `ADD` or `COPY` directives in your Dockerfile, the build context is relative to your container's directory

1. Add an entry to `.github/dependabot.yml` by running

    ```bash
    bash scripts/dependabot/configuration-generator.sh
    ```

1. Submit your changes using a pull request
