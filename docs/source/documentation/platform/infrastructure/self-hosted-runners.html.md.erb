# <%= current_page.data.title %>

There are certain scenarios where we may need to run GitHub Actions workflows that are not on GitHub's managed infrastructure, for example:

- A repository that contains sensitive data that cannot be made public

To facilitate this, we can offer a self-hosted runner that runs on Data Platform's EKS cluster.

## How to request a self-hosted runner

_TBC_, but generally on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the [Data Platform team](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04VBJTKY58)

## How to prepare a self-hosted runner

The intended audience for section is the Data Platform Apps and Tools Team

1. Login to GitHub using the Data Platform Robot account (credentials are [1Password](https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=WEXD5VMFTVBH7LG7FFDWUV7MC4&v=tahmy4wjhm2zr2ld5qbqxl4ufi&i=5kszssdbqto3kakijll25flaje&h=ministryofjustice.1password.eu))

1. Create a repository scoped fine-grained access token with the following permissions:

  - Read access to metadata
  - Read and Write access to administration

1. Create a new Secrets Manager secret in analytical-platform-management-production eu-west-2 called `github/actions/self-hosted-runner/${REPOSITORY_NAME}`

1. Create a new entry in `terraform/dpat-eks/production/actions-runners/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.tf`, replacing `${GITHUB_ORGANISATION}` and `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` with the appropriate values:

    ```hcl
    data "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "github_actions_self_hosted_runner_${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" {
      provider = aws.analytical-platform-management-production

      name = "github/actions/self-hosted-runner/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"
    }

    data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "github_actions_self_hosted_runner_${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" {
      provider = aws.analytical-platform-management-production

      secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.github_actions_self_hosted_runner_${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.id
    }

    resource "helm_release" "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" {
      name      = "actions-runner-(moj|mojas)-${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"
      repository = "oci://ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/data-platform-charts"
      version    = "2.0.0"
      chart      = "actions-runner"
      namespace  = "actions-runners"

      set {
        name  = "github.organisation"
        value = "${GITHUB_ORGANISATION}"
      }

      set {
        name  = "github.repository"
        value = "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"
      }

      set {
        name  = "github.token"
        value = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.github_actions_self_hosted_runner_${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.secret_string
      }

      set {
        name  = "github.runner.labels"
        value = "moj-data-platform"
      }

      set {
        name  = "serviceAccount.annotations.eks\\.amazonaws\\.com/role-arn"
        value = "arn:aws:iam::593291632749:role/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Deploy the changes using the normal pull request process

## How to use a self-hosted runner

When a self-hosted runner is deployed, it will automatically register itself with GitHub. You can see the runner in the repository's settings

To consume it in a workflow, add the following to the workflow's `runs-on` section:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, moj-data-platform]
```
