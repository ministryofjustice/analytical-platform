# <%= current_page.data.title %>

There are initially three different roles of users of the Data Platform:

* Data producer
* Data analysis
* Data consumer

![Data platform general diagram](images/who-uses-the-data-platform.png "Data platform user diagram")

During an initial exploration, the following desires were explored for each of the roles above. It’s worth noting that this list was generated exclusively by technical members of the team, with no contact to the actual users. The main purpose here isn’t necessarily to define functionalities, but to help guide possible directions.

After grouping these desires on what a Data Ingestion team would be responsible for, this is what we get:

**Data Producer**

*   Wants imported data to have quality

    *   What is quality data?

        *   no data duplication

        *   not nulls

        *   some basic validation during import

        *   feedback on data validation failures

*   Wants to know what is required of them in order for their data to be ingested

*   Wants to control who can access their data

    *   may have data security requirements (official, sensitive, etc)

*   Wants to manage lifecycle of their data so that it complies with retention requirements (GDPR, DPA, etc)

*   Wants to have technological freedom on their systems - how the data is exported and ingested shouldn't affect how their systems are built

*   Wants to be able to easily transfer data to the platform, in different ways:

    *   batch upload

    *   events stream

    *   ad hoc data

    *   periodic upload

    *   sensitive data


**Data Processing / Analyst**

*   Wants up to date reference data for linking it with other sources

*   Wants to find data that relates to the source that they are currently using, in order to use it (or not)

*   Wants to understand what data is so they can determine if it's the right thing to answer a question

*   Wants to understand data quality so I can make informed decisions about how I use data

**Data Consumer**

*   Wants to find existing data that interests them (potentially in order to do a raw data export)


These are some desires that should be covered by the platform as a whole:

**Data Producer**

*   Wants to produce useful data, and know if it's being used and by whom

*   Wants assurance that the platform is secure so I know it's suitable for compliance requirements

*   Wants to replace legacy reporting systems, which may also be expensive

**Data Processing / Analyst**

*   Wants to understand data quality so I can make informed decisions about how I use data

*   Wants to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, so they can focus on activities that add value

*   Wants to be able to access data easily for which I have a genuine need so they can do their work

*   Wants to link and compare their data with existing data

*   Wants to extra or create a subset from new data available<br>Wants to share data with their team so that they are working from the same source of truth

**Data Consumer**

*   Wants to find existing data that interests them (potentially in order to do a dashboard)

*   Wants to access good quality of data

*   Wants to have a singe source of truth for data
