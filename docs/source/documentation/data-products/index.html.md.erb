Here you will find documentation describing the concept of a Data Product within the [Data Platform](/documentation/).

> **NOTE**

> these pages are *primarily* for internal audiences rather than users of the Data Platform;
we will host user-facing documentation separately.

## Definition

Put simply, a Data Product is a dataset or group of datasets **together with metadata that describes that data**.
This will include descriptors and guidance on the usage of the data,
as well as governance information regarding the ownership and retention period of the data within the platform.

## Purpose

A Data Product exists to help customers effectively find, understand, and responsibly use data,
as well as help administration and management of that data within the platform.

A Data Product is created and owned by a Data Product Owner, a person with comprehensive domain knowledge.
The Data Product Owner is not part of the Data Platform team,
they are people that operate on different teams and they have a system that contains data that they would like to share.
This is because it is essential to know a domain before creating a Data Product,
and it would be impossible for the Data Platform teams to have deep knowledge of every domain that uses the platform.

## Goals

Our goals are:

- Make data easily discoverable by users who wish to use that data.
We do this by encouraging the owners of Data Products to supply high quality [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)
- Make it easier for us to provide governance for data,
for example by identfying owners, protective markings and retention periods.
- Make data more usable, whatever the purpose, by applying product thinking to our data,
and clearly describing the lineage and transformations of our Data Products

## Defining a Data Product

> **IMPORTANT**

> The structure and usage of these metadata definitions are likely to change substantially throughout development

A Data Product will have a unique name, and is defined in code: YAML or JSON
(we show YAML in these docs, as it is a more human-readable format).
The code representation of the Data Product is referred to as Data Product Metadata (data *about* the data), and is currently captured in a single file.

This file contains the following sections:

| Section name | Purpose | Documentation |
| - | - | - |
| `specification` | Aids data discoverability by providing a name, description and tags for a Data Product. It also contains contact details of the Data Product owner. | [Data Product specification](components/product-specification.html) |
| `governance` | Contains protective marking, retention period, expected update frequency and data lineage. | [Defining product governance](components/product-governance.html) |
| `data-dictionary` | Contains the column defintions comprising the Data Product, along with type information and user-friendly names. | [Data dictionary guidance](components/data-dictionary-definitions.html) |

Sections of metadata that we plan to capture within a Data Product, but are not yet implemented:

| File name | Purpose | Documentation |
| - | - | - |
| `transformations` | Describes the [cleaning](components/data-cleansing-definitions.html) and [transformation](components/data-transformation-definitions.html) data will undergo before it is made available to consumers. | [Cleaning](components/data-cleansing-definitions.html) and [transformation](components/data-transformation-definitions.html) |
