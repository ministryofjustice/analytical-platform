Each Data Product will be versioned, with the first version released at `v1.0`. Versions include a major version and a minor version.

### What utility does versioning give the data consumer?

Data consumers are made aware of changes to Data Products through versioning.

> Data consumers must update the major version of a Data Product in any code/tools which they use themselves, as major version changes could cause downstream processes consuming a Data Product to break.

## Criteria for major vs. minor version increments

Changes to Data Products shouldn't happen very often.
All Data Product owners want to avoid their users having to update their products to bump the major version of a consumed Data Product too often, and also avoid users having to make choices about if a change is a breaking change or not.

### Minor version increment criteria

If all of the changes to your Data Product meet these criteria, then the minor version will be incremented:

* Add whole new data asset schema - For example: adding an additional table to a Data Product
* Add new metadata field at the Data Product level - For example: adding a new keyword tag or changing the description of a Data Product
* Adding a column to a table
* Descriptions added or updated for a table or existing column in a table (change to descriptive metadata for a data asset)

All other changes will result in a major version increment. For example the following will all result in a major version bump:

* Updating the column type for an existing column in a data asset
* Deleting a column for an existing column in a data asset
* Deleting/removing a table (data asset) from a Data Product

Where possible we aim to infer the type of version (major/minor) increment required, based on the type of change being made.
