# Defining Data Product governance

Use the [`governance`](/documentation/data-products/example_data_product/governance.yml) section in your Data Product YAML definition file to indicate to users, and to the Data Platform itself, how the data should be handled, and where it has come from. A correctly specficied set of governance attributes gives you and platform users confidence in handling and using the data.

## Example

<!--  data-controller: "moj"
  review-after: "2023-12-31"
  senior-information-risk-owner: "information.asset.owner.name@justice.gov.uk"
  protective-marking: "None" -->

```yaml
governance:
  dataProductOwner: data.product.owner.name@justice.gov.uk
  dataProductOwnerDisplayName: Data Product Owner
  dpiaRequired: false

  retention:
    retentionPeriod: 366

  lineage:
    domain: "HMPPS"
```

## Notes

### Ownership and handling attributes

- `dataProductOwner` - the email address of the owner for this Data Product.
- `dataProductOwnerDisplayName` - display name of the owner for this Data Product.
- `dpiaRequired` - `true` or `false`
<!--
- `data-controller` - the Data Controller as pertains to the Data Protection Act. This will commonly be "moj" but could be another entity.
- `review-after` - the next date on which the governance information should be reviewed. Data Products owners will be notified of this review window using the contact information supplied in the [Data Product specification](product-specification.html).
- `protective-marking` - one of "Official", "Official Sensitive", or "None" (for published data).
- `senior-information-risk-owner` should be the email address of the Senior Information Risk Owner for this data.
- `dpiaReference` - Reference number for associated DPIA -->

> **DO NOT SEND SECRET OR TOP SECRET DATA TO THE PLATFORM.**

### Data retention

You should indicate to the platform how long the data should be kept before removal using the `retentionPeriod` field.

- `retentionPeriod` - number of days before the data is removed from the platform based on the date the Data Product was added to the platform

<!-- the `retention-strategy` attribute.

Data retention supports two strategies:

- `date-uploaded` - the retention period is based on the date & time the data was added to the platform; or
- `forever` -

- `data-date-key` - the retention period is based on dates within the data itself. For this strategy the [data dictionary](data-dictionary-definitions.html) must contain key date fields for all datasets.

For these strategies, you must also supply a time unit and values. Supported values for `retention-unit` are:

- `months`
- `years`

The `retention-value` should be a whole number indicating how many of the `retention-unit` elapses before the retention policy is applied. For example:

```yaml
retention:
  retention-strategy: "data-date-key"
  retention-unit: "years"
  retention-value: 3
```

Would be implemented as _"delete any data older than 3 years, based on the date field for each table"_.
-->

You can specify `0` for data which is allowed to be kept indefinitely - for example anonymised management information or published statistics.

<!-- If `forever` is specified, the `retention-unit` and `retention-value` values are ignored - they are included above to provide a more complete example.
-->

Data Products owners will be notified of retention policies being applied using the contact information supplied in the [Data Product specification](data-product-specification.html).

<!--
### Data updates

You should indicate to the platform, and to users, how frequently the data will be updated using the `update-frequency` attribute. This requires two values:

- `update-unit`
- `update-value`

Supported values for `update-unit` are:

- `days`
- `weeks`
- `months`

The `update-value` should be a whole number indicating how many of the `update-unit` will elapse before the next upate is sent. For example:

```yaml
update-frequency:
  update-unit: "months"
  update-value: 3
```

Would be implemented as _"new data will be supplied every three months"_. We don't support multiples of years, but a dataset with annual updates can be specified as having a 12 month update cycle.

If a data update cycle is missed, Data Product owners will be notified via the contact information supplied in the [Data Product specification](product-specification.html).
-->

### Data lineage

It is important to users of the data that they know where it has come from. This is the purpose of the `lineage` collection of attributes.

- `domain` - defines at a high level which part of the organisation the data has come from. Must be one of: "HMCTS", "HMPPS", "LAA", "OPG", "HQ"
<!--
- `organisational-unit` (currently known as `domain`)
- `source` - the detailed source of the data. Can be a system such as "NOMIS" or "XHIBIT" or the URL of a statistical publication
- \- **OR** \-
- `parent-products` - if your Data Product is based on another Data Product(s), please specify their name here. (The Data Product `name` fieldas it appears in the list of data platform product folders, not the user-friendly title of the product).

Note if `parent-product` is supplied then `source` is ignored.
-->
