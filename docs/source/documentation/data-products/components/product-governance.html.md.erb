Use the [`governance`](/documentation/data-products/example_data_product/governance.yml) section in your Data Product YAML definition file to indicate to users, and to the Data Platform itself, how the data should be handled, and where it has come from. A correctly specficied set of governance attributes gives you and platform users confidence in handling and using the data.

## Example

<!-- (Alpha) -->
```yaml
domain: HMPPS
dataProductOwner: data.product.owner.name@justice.gov.uk
dataProductOwnerDisplayName: Data Product Owner
dpiaRequired: false
retentionPeriod: 400
```

including optional fields:
```yaml
domain: HMPPS
dataProductOwner: data.product.owner.name@justice.gov.uk
dataProductOwnerDisplayName: Data Product Owner
dataProductMaintainer: data.product.maintainer.name@justice.gov.uk
dataProductMaintainerDisplayName: Data Product Maintainer
dpiaRequired: false
dpiaLocation: s3://data-platform-data/civil-courts-data/v1/
retentionPeriod: 400
```

<!-- (Beta) -->
<!--
```yaml
governance:
  ownership:
    data-controller: moj
    owner:
      email: data.product.owner.name@justice.gov.uk
      name: Data Product Owner
  dpia-required: false
  protective-marking: None
  retention-period: 400

  lineage:
    organisational-unit: HMPPS
```
-->

<!-- (Later) -->

-->


<!-- (Alpha) -->
#### optional:

- `dataProductMaintainerDisplayName` - display name of the maintainer for this Data Product

> **DO NOT SEND SECRET OR TOP SECRET DATA TO THE PLATFORM.**

### Data retention

<!-- (Alpha) -->
You should indicate to the platform how long the data should be kept before removal using the `retentionPeriod` field.

- `retentionPeriod` - number of days before the data is removed from the platform based on the date the Data Product was added to the platform

For example: `retentionPeriod: 400` is implemented as _"delete any data older than 400 days, based on when the data was added to the Platform"_.

You can specify `0` for data which is allowed to be kept indefinitely - for example anonymised management information or published statistics.

Data Products owners will be notified of retention policies being applied using the contact information supplied in the [Data Product specification](product-specification.html).

<!--
You should indicate to the platform how long the data should be kept before removal using the `retention-period` field.

- `retention-period` - number of days before the data is removed from the platform based on the date the Data Product was added to the platform

For example:

```yaml
governance:
  retention-period: 400
```

This is implemented as _"delete any data older than 400 days, based on when the data was added to the Platform"_.

You can specify `0` for data which is allowed to be kept indefinitely - for example anonymised management information or published statistics.

-->

<!-- (Later) -->
<!--
The retention period indicates to the platform how long the data should be kept before removal using the `retention` fields. It is based on the date & time the data was added to the platform.

- `retention: period` - integer amount of `unit`s of time
- `retention: unit` - one of: "months", "years"

For example:

```yaml
governance:
  retention:
    period: 13
    unit: months
```

This is implemented as _"delete any data older than 13 months, based on when the data was added to the Platform"_.

You can specify a period of `0` for data which is allowed to be kept indefinitely - for example anonymised management information or published statistics.

Data Products owners will be notified of retention policies being applied using the contact information supplied in the `governance: ownership: maintainers: data-product` and `specification: support`.

### Data updates

You should indicate to the platform, and to users, how frequently the data will be updated using the `update` attributes. This requires two values:

- `update: periods` - integer amount of `unit`s of time
- `update: unit` - one of: "days", "weeks", "months"

Example:

```yaml
update:
  periods: 4
  unit: "weeks"
```

Would be implemented as _"new data will be supplied every four weeks"_. We don't support multiples of years, but a dataset with annual updates can be specified as having a 12 month update cycle.

If a data update cycle is missed, Data Product owners will be notified via the contact information supplied in the `governance: ownership: maintainers: data-product` and `specification: support`. -->

### Data lineage

<!-- (Alpha) -->
It is important to users of the data that they know where it has come from. This is the purpose of the lineage attribute:

- `domain` - defines at a high level which part of the organisation the data has come from. Must be one of: "HMCTS", "HMPPS", "LAA", "OPG", "HQ"

<!-- (Beta) -->
<!-- It is important to users of the data that they know where it has come from. This is the purpose of the `lineage` collection of attributes.

- `lineage: organisational-unit` - defines at a high level which part of the organisation the data has come from. Must be one of: "HMCTS", "HMPPS", "LAA", "OPG", "HQ" -->
<!-- (Later)
- `lineage: source` - the detailed source of the data. Can be a system such as "NOMIS" or "XHIBIT" or the URL of a statistical publication
- `lineage: parent-products` - if your Data Product is based on one of more other Data Products, please specify their names here. (The Data Product `name` field as it appears in the list of data platform product folders, not the user-friendly title of the product).

Note if `parent-product` is supplied then `source` is ignored.
