## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

We do not offer a managed data visualisation and reporting tool. Users need to build and run these applications themselves using [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) or [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

[PowerBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_BI) comes part of our Microsoft 365 subscription, but connecting to data on our platform requires additional [infrastructure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/using-power-bi-with-aws-cloud/connecting-the-microsoft-power-bi-service-to-aws-data-sources.html).

 If we offered AWS QuickSight, we can reduce our current support burden from new RShiny deployments, and give new and existing users simpler visualisation and reporting capabilities.

## Decision

- _proposed - We will offer AWS QuickSight to our users. QuickSight is fully managed and can be integrated into our identity management system._

## Consequences

### General consequences

- Users can build and share dashboards from data stored on our platform
- Operates on a pay-as-you-go [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/) model, which means we are billed based on actual usage
- QuickSight is designed to be user-friendly (no coding required), but users might face issues when dealing with more advanced or complex use cases
- We will need to start a QuickSight community for users to help and share their experiences and knowledge
- There is already a public [QuickSight community](https://community.amazonquicksight.com/)

### Advantages

- Serverless BI service, meaning we do not need to patch or maintain and [security and compliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/QS-compliance.html) is maintained by AWS
- User friendly interface and extensive online training materials, we won't need to produce extensive documentation to support, AWS provides many resources for building and sharing dashboards
- Reduced operational cost and complexity for users to create reports and visualisations
- AWS provided immersion days and free training for our users
- Cost transparency, the total cost of ownership and management of RShiny and other hosted solutions is hard to calculate

### Disadvantages

- [Application configuration as code](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-quicksight-assets-as-code-sample) does not support all resources
- The internal permission management is complex and difficult to understand
