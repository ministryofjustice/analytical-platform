# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Our users want to explore and leverage [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLM)for various use cases.
Our platform lacks the resources required to run these models.

## Decision

We will offer [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to our users.
Amazon Bedrock is fully managed [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLM) which offers many foundation models which be customised privately using techniques such as fine tuning and [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html)

## Consequences

### General consequences

* Bedrock provides pre-trained models with limited ability to customise or tune the models
* Bedrock pricing is based on usage and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on your application's traffic and costs could spike unexpectedly. Usage is metered and billed per inference request based on factors like model used, input length, and response length
* Bedrock models are accessed via an API using AWS authentication keys

### Advantages

* Serverless access to large language models meaning that our platform and users don't need to manage and maintain infrastructure

### Disadvantages

* Limited model selection, Bedrock offers a few pre-trained models and new models can take time to reach all AWS regions
