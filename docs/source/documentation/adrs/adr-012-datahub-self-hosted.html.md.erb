## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

A data catalogue for the MOJ is a critical pillar of the Data Platform. Following a review of open source catalogues, [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/) was selected as the preferred tool.

Since [Acryl Data](https://www.acryldata.io/acryl-datahub) offer a SaaS version of DataHub, this ADR is concerned with the choice of how we host our catalogue.

## Analysis

There are two options:

- We use Acryl Data's managed SaaS offering
- We host DataHub ourselves using one of our two strategic hosting platforms:
  - [Cloud Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform)
  - [Modernisation Platform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform)

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages:

### SaaS (third-party managed) hosting

#### Advantages

- We do not have to provision and manage infrastructre
- Availability and uptime are part of a paid-for SLA
- Version updates and patches are managed for us
- We do not need a deep understanding of the internals of the application
- Team members do not have to spend time configuring and deploying the application

#### Disadvantages

- We have less control over what infrastructure is provisioned
- Hosting costs will be higher
- Procurement for a recurring, licensed product would cause significant delays in getting an application to users
- A supplier relationship and contract will need to be managed and monitored
- Private sector entities can be acquired by another entity, or IPOs can initiate unexpected changes to a service or its pricing

### In-house hosting

#### Advantages

- We have much greater control over the provisioning of resources
- Our strategic hosting platforms are security baselined
- Our hosting costs will be lower, since they will include any volume discounts and not include third-party margins
- Connecting the catalogue to our other internal systems will be more straightforward (i.e. our SSO service and catalogue metadata ingestion)
- We are easily able to provision dev/test and staging instances
- Acryl provide helm charts for self-hosting, so we are not required to create the deployments from scratch

#### Disadvantages

- We are responsible for SLAs, uptime etc.
- We are responsible for updates and patches<sup>1</sup>
- Our team requires a deep knowledge of the setup and configuation of the application<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Arguably, an advantage, in that we also gain control over **when** upgrades are rolled out, and they can be tested in a preprod environment beforehand.

<sup>2</sup> Arguably, also an advantage.

## Decision

The internal hosting advantages of cost, security and connectivity outweigh any advantaged of third-party SaaS hosting. The decision is to **host DataHub internally, using Cloud Platform**.

## Consequences

The Data Platform teams will need to:

- Understand the DataHub deployment stack
- Create Cloud Platform environments
- Integrate Entra ID into the application
- Deploy the application
