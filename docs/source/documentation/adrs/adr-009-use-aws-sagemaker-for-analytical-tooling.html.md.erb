# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Our Data Scientist want the ability to make use modelling with GPU which is not currently available, and the options with specialised CPU and higher memory to aid analytical applications.

## Decision

We will look to offer [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to our users.

## Consequences

* Leverage managed services like SageMaker Studio
* SageMaker pricing is based on usage and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on your application's usage, instance type and costs could spike unexpectedly
* Workloads will be run in isolation mode without access to the internet to secure sensitive data
* Users can make use of services when available and require development of front and backend service
* Greater choice in open source Foundation Models and VPC isolation for highly sensitive data
