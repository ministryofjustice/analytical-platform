## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Our user want analytical features not available on our existing platform. The types of tools and underlying compute is changing rapidly. SageMaker provides a managed service for these tools and provides instances with higher resources and GPU to speed and aid research.

There is also a lot of interest in using LLMs for e.g.semantic search of free text. SageMaker in VPC isolation mode makes sure sensitive workloads are secured and stay within the [instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) and data is connected via PrivateLink.

## Decision

- _proposed - We will look to offer [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to our users_

## Proposal General Consequences

- [SageMaker cost](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/) is based on usage and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on your application's usage, instance type and costs could spike unexpectedly
- Improved Security, workloads will run in isolation mode (without access to internet) to further secure sensitive data
- Users can make use of services when available and require development of front and backend service
- Greater choice in open source Foundation Models and VPC isolation for highly sensitive data
- Reduced operational cost and complexity
- Agility and change readiness, additional analytical services can be offered when available without considerable effort that has lead to users having to work elsewhere
- Better cost transparency, we will understand our tooling compute costs
- SageMaker JumpStart does not download models from a public model zoo, it can be used in fully locked-down environments as well where there is **no internet access**
- Network access can be limited and scoped down for SageMaker JumpStart models, this helps teams improve the security posture of the environment
- Due to the VPC boundaries, access to the endpoint can also be limited via subnets and security groups, which adds an extra layer of security
- Leverage managed services like [SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/)
- If successful we can close down our current tooling [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). EKS although managed still requires a considerable amount of effort to run with the endless upgrades taking away people from doing more useful tasks
