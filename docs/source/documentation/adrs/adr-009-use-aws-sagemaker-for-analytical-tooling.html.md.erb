# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

Our user want features not available on our existing platform. SageMaker provides a managed service for these tools and provides instances with higher resources and GPU to aid research.

## Decision

- _proposed - We will look to offer [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to our users_

## Proposal Consequences

- Leverage managed services like SageMaker Studio
- SageMaker cost is based on usage and can vary significantly month-to-month depending on your application's usage, instance type and costs could spike unexpectedly
- Improved Security, workloads will run in isolation mode (without access to internet) to further secure sensitive data
- Users can make use of services when available and require development of front and backend service
- Greater choice in open source Foundation Models and VPC isolation for highly sensitive data
- Reduced operational cost and complexity
- Agility and change readiness, additional analytical services can be offered when available
- Better cost transparency, we will understand our tooling compute costs
