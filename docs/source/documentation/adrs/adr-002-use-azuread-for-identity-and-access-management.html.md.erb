## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Context

The Data Platform will need to provide a way to verify users and provide access to resources.
We do not want to run an identity service and want to reduce the number of identies our users have to manage.

## Decision

We will use AzureAD for Identity and Access Manangment (IDAM).
There are mulitple identity services in the MoJ, the majority of our users are already using a `@justice.gov.uk` account.
This will allow our users to Single Sign On (SSO) onto their devices and gain access to our services without the need to
enter another username and password.

## Consequences

- We will not have to run an identity service along with managing multi factor authentication, logging and security of that system.
- Guest accounts are possible but not managed currently which means we will need an alternative solution.
- x-government federation is a possibility
- Devices can be challenged for additonal verification if accessing restricted data.
