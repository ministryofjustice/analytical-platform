The use of a multi-account strategy will give the Data Platform a scalable storage architecture which adheres to AWS best practices (see)[AWS Well-Architected Framework](http://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)Â pillars on operational excellence, security, reliability, and cost optimisation.

The just create a lot of data without any lifecycle or metadata controls.
