We use GitHub Issues to manage support requests for both the Analytical Platform and Data Platform.

To submit a support ticket you need a GitHub account.

If you cannot access GitHub, use the following channels in the **Justice Digital** Slack workspace to ask for help:

- **#analytical-platform-support**
- **#ask-data-platform**

We will review your request and prioritise it accordingly.
