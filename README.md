## About this repository

This is the Ministry of Justice Analytical Platform team's repository for public-facing documentation, feature work, enhancements, and issues.

The Analytical Platform team use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/issues) to track their work and a GitHub [Project](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/27) to manage it.

## Analytical Platform repositories

We use a series of repositories for our work. We have adopted a naming convention where each repository starts with `analytical-platform-*`.

We [name things](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/naming-things.html#naming-things) so that users can understand what a repository does through its name.

For a list of Analytical Platform repositories, please use [GitHub Code Search](https://github.com/search?q=org:ministryofjustice+topic:analytical-platform&type=repositories&s=updated&o=desc).
