## About this repository

The Analytical Platform provides users with a place to store, ingest and consume data.

This repository holds the Ministry of Justice’s Analytical Platforms published technical documentation and code to build the analytical infrastructure for our users.

For more information on the Analytical Platform please see the [user guidance](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/index.html).

## Analytical Platform repositories

We have a series of repositories for our work. We have adopted the naming
convention of naming each repository starting with `analytical-platform-*`.

We also [name things](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/naming-things.html#naming-things)
so that users can understand what a repository does through its name.

The repositories we manage with terraform see [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-github-access/blob/main/analytical-platform-repositories.tf).

## Editing and publishing the Technical Documentation

The [published](https://docs.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)
documentation is created by editing `*.html.md.erb` files,
found in the [`source`](/source/) folder.

The syntax is Markdown, more details can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

While editing the files locally, you can start a Docker container that will use
Middleman to act as a server hosting the web pages. See [preview docs](#preview-docs).

Every change should be reviewed in a pull request, no matter how minor.
PR request reviewer/s should be enabled within the main branch protection
settings.

Merging the changes to the `main` branch automatically publishes the
changes via GH Action. See [publishing](#publishing).

### Preview docs

You can preview how your changes will look, if you've cloned this repository
to your local machine, run this command:

```bash
make preview
```

This will run a preview web server on <http://localhost:4567> which you can
open in your browser.

Use `bash scripts/docs/docker.sh check` to compile
the site to HTML and check the URLs are valid.

This is only accessible on your computer, and won't be accessible to anyone
else.

For more details see the
[tech-docs-github-pages-publisher](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/tech-docs-github-pages-publisher)
repository.

### Publishing

Any changes you push/merge into the
`main` branch should be published to GitHub Pages site automatically.

### Template configuration

The web page layout is configured using the config/tech-docs.yml file.

The template can be configured in [config/tech-docs.yml](config/tech-docs.yml)

Further configuration options are described on the Tech Docs Template
site: [Global Configuration](https://github.com/alphagov/tdt-documentation/blob/main/config/tech-docs.yml).
