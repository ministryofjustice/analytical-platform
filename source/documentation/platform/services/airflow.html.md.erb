ðŸŒ± _Amazon Managed Apache Airflow is a platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows_

Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA) orchestrates your workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) written in Python. You provide MWAA an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket where your DAGs, plugins, and Python requirements reside. Then run and monitor your DAGs from the AWS Management Console, a command line interface (CLI), a software development kit (SDK), or the Apache Airflow user interface (UI).
