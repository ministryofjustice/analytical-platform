# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Analytical Platform is built using many differenct core technolgies (AWS, Kubernetes, Container and Python, etc.)

To ease the development process of each component/repository, we have created a [dev container](https://containers.dev/) that contains all the tools required.

There are two methods for using dev containers:

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), but this optional, as the Ministry of Justice doesn't pay for this, it is down to the user to pick up the cost.

- Locally on macOS

This documentation will cover running locally on macOS, because GitHub Codespaces is a one-click operation.

## Getting Started on macOS

### Prerequisites

- macOS

- Homebrew

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

- 1Password

    [You will need to request access to 1Password via Operations Engineering](https://cloud-optimisation-and-accountability.justice.gov.uk/documentation/operations-engineering-legacy/operations-engineering-user-guide/password-management/1password.html#request-access).

    ```bash
    brew install 1password
    ```

- Docker

    > If you are have an Apple Silicon Mac, you will need to enable Rosetta emulation, see Docker's [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#general:~:text=Use%20Rosetta%20for%20x86/AMD64%20emulation%20on%20Apple%20Silicon) for more information.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask docker
    ```

- Node

    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```

- Dev Container CLI

    ```bash
    sudo npm install --location=global @devcontainers/cli@latest
    ```

- Visual Studio Code

    ```bash
    brew install --cask visual-studio-code
    ```

- Dev Containers Visual Studio Code Extension

    ```bash
    /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
    ```

### Setup

Your GPG and SSH agents are mounted from macOS, so GPG and SSH commands inside the container should work without any configuration updates

> We recommend using 1Password to manage your SSH keys, and this document will reflect that

1. Follow 1Password's instructions on how to setup SSH keys and their SSH agent ([link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/))

> If you already have an existing key, you can add it to 1Password ([link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/manage-keys/#import-an-ssh-key)) and skip to step 3 of 1Password's instructions.

1. Permanently set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` by adding the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file

    ```bash
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/Library/Group\ Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock
    ```

1. Clone one of the Analytical Platform repositories, for this example we'll use `analytical-platform`

      <details>

      <summary>Example</summary>

      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/Developer/github.com/ministryofjustice

      git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/analytical-platform.git ~/Developer/github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform
      ```

      </details>

1. Open the Analytical Platform repository in Visual Studio Code

      <details>

      <summary>Example</summary>

      ```bash
      cd ~/Developer/github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform

      /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code .
      ```

      </details>

1. Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette using `Shift-Command-P`

1. Run `Dev Container: Reopen in Container`

1. Wait for the container to build, it may take 5 to 10 minutes

### Updating

When new functionality is added you will need to rebuild the container, to do this:

1. Pull the latest changes from the Analytical Platform repository on the host machine

      <details>

      <summary>Example</summary>

      ```bash
      cd ~/Developer/github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform

      git fetch

      git pull
      ```

      </details>

1. Open the Analytical Platform repository in Visual Studio Code

      <details>

      <summary>Example</summary>

      ```bash
      cd ~/Developer/github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform

      /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code .
      ```

      </details>

1. Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette using `Shift-Command-P`

1. Run `Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
