One of the key activities of the Analytical Platform team is dealing with ‘Feature Requests’. Due to the high numbers and frequency of ‘Feature Requests’ received by the team, there is a need to review the current process for dealing with them.

## Requests to the team

- Analytical Platform user raises request ticket. Some of the requests are raised based on discussions with the team.
- Team members can raise [requests](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature-request-template.yml&title=+%E2%9C%A8+%3Ctitle%3E) based on a [support issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues) or engagement with users.

## Amigos reviews

The Amigo's will review the [feature-request](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/labels/feature-request) labelled issues and establish if there is enough information. If not, the Product Manager or Team will contact the requestor and gather more information

## Prioritisation of the Feature Request

- Once the necessary information is captured, the Amigos prioritised the requests based on the following:
- Criticality of request to the users of the Analytical Platform performing their duties
Value the request will add to user experience of the platform
Timelines of the requests (when it needs to be done)

## Feature Request brought into the sprint

- Issue gets refined by the team.
- Once the requests are prioritised, the decision to bring that into the sprint is made.
- The agreed plan is to use the original feature request ticket to deal with the request. However, in certain circumstances, there may be a need for the team to create a new ticket where the story would be defined,  set definition of done etc, and link it to the feature request.
