# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This document will explain how we respond to [feature requests](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature-request-template.yml&title=+%E2%9C%A8+%3Ctitle%3E) that are created by our users and our team.

## Requests to the team

Requests can come in a few different paths the most common are;

- Analytical Platform user raises [feature request](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues/new/choose)
- Discussion with user via email or Slack where our team will ask if they can raise a formal request or do so on their behalf if for example they do not have a GitHub account
- Discussion with user via email or Slack where our team will ask if they can raise a formal request or do so on their behalf if for example they do not have a GitHub account
- Team members can raise [requests](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature-request-template.yml&title=+%E2%9C%A8+%3Ctitle%3E) based on a [support issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues) or engagement with users

## Amigos reviews

The Amigos will review the [feature-request](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/labels/feature-request) labelled issues and establish if there is enough information. If not, the Product Manager or Team will contact the requestor and gather more information

## Prioritisation of the Feature Request

- Once the necessary information is captured, the Amigos prioritise the requests based on the following
- Criticality of request to the users of the Analytical Platform performing their duties
- Value the request will add to user experience of the platform
- Timelines of the requests (when it needs to be done)

## Feature Request brought into the sprint

- Issue gets refined by the team
- Once the requests are prioritised, the decision to bring that into the sprint is made
- The agreed plan is to use the original feature request ticket to deal with the request. Stories may be created by the team to create a new ticket where the story would be defined, making sure there is a definition of done etc, with additional issues linked to the feature request
