# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

We have many methods for managing access to data which can be difficult for new users. [Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/what-is-lake-formation.html) will streamline data sharing capabilities while maintaining governance and security controls.

## Decision

We will use Lake Formation to merge and simplify data sharing for our users.

## Consequences

### General consequences

- We will need to build and maintain a central tag repository to avoid tagging collisions
- We will still require a solution for unstructured data

### Advantages

- Enables secure data sharing across accounts reducing data duplication
- Improved data compliance management and auditing
- Data owners can control of who has access to their data
- Row and column level security reduces need to duplicate non sensitive data
- Fine and coarse-grain access control with attributes from users Entra ID profile
- We can make use of tag based access control [TBAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/tag-based-access-control.html) also known as attribute-based access control [ABAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac). This reduces the number of access policies that need modification as new database, table and columns are added

### Disadvantages

- Onboarding of datasets will need more up front work by engineers
