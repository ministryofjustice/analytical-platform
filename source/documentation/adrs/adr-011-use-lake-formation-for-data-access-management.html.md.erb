# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

We have multiple ways to assign permissions to data, we are missing features like fine-grained access controls, column and row level security which leads to data being duplicated. We are also getting more requests for sensitive data to be shared [across accounts](/documentation/adrs/adr-009-use-separate-aws-accounts-for-data.html).

## Decision

We will use [Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/what-is-lake-formation.html) to securely manage and govern data access on the Analytical Platform. This will enable fine-grained control, row and column level security the ability to leave data in place and remove the need to setup pipelines to move data unnecessarily.

## Consequences

### General consequences

- We will need to support and maintain a Terraform module for teams to enable and configure Lake Formation
- We will need to build and maintain a central tag repository to avoid tagging collisions
- We will still require a solution for unstructured data

### Advantages

- Enables secure data sharing across accounts. Data can stay within the account it without the need for exporting or pipelines which reduces duplication
- Integration with AWS Identity Center and our existing identity management system
- Improved data compliance with improved [security event logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/security-event-logging.html) and auditing capabilities
- Data owners can control of who has access to their data
- Row and column level security reduces need to duplicate non sensitive data
- Fine and coarse-grain access control with attributes from users Entra ID profile
- We can make use of tag based access control [TBAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/tag-based-access-control.html) also known as attribute-based access control [ABAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac). This reduces the number of access policies that need modification as new database, table and columns are added

### Disadvantages

- Onboarding of datasets will need more up front work by engineers
