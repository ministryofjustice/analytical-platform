## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) is integrating with Entra ID. We can simplify logon and access to the Analytical Platform by making use of [customer managed application's](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps.html) registered with Identity Center for our users.

## Decision

  We will use a [customer managed application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps.html) registered with AWS Identity Center to authenticate and authorise users access to Analytical Platform and [AWS managed applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/awsapps.html).

## Consequences

### General consequences

- [Trusted identity propagation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.html) will authorise access to AWS resources based on the user’s identity context and securely share the user’s identity context with other AWS services.
- We won't need to manage certificates for our applications against Entra ID, these will be managed by the [Modernisation Platform Team](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

### Advantages

- Centralised Cloudtrail logging against a single identity helps us identify requests made to AWS services
- Our proposed solution will simplify the JML process by handling user removal through the existing JML processes and will not need to be handled by our team
- Makes possible end-to-end auditing of users' AWS activities easily reconciled to their Entra ID identity

### Disadvantages

- We will continue to require additional services to maintain access to Analytical Platform for users outside of JusticeUK
