## Tools

### Communication

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication. This applies to our ceremonies as well, we have these in Huddles in the [`#analytical-platform`](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04M8224WCV) channel.

We use Slack huddles for pairing or direct calls and occasionally we use Google Meet.

Our main Slack channels are:

#### #analytical-platform

The [#analytical-platform](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04M8224WCV) channel is our team channel, where we have discussions covering wide range of topics, including:

- in-depth technical issues
- our plans for the day
- to request someone else from the team's help
- weekend plans
- when we're away for lunch
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update in the daily standup thread.
