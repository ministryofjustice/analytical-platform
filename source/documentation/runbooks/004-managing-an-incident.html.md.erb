# Incident Process

This document describes our incident handling process for network, operations and security issues.

> This document assumes the user has a PagerDuty account and is part of the Analytical Platform team.  To use the in Slack features the user must authorise the PagerDuty application in Slack.

## 1. Confirm that the event constitutes an incident

> If this incident constitutes a security breach, you must also report it [here](https://goo.gl/forms/frsB1h8AGv3Zefwq2)

We define an incident as an event which:

* is unplanned, and
* impacts end users or our direct users (developers and engineers), or
* degrades user-facing services, or
* increases risk to production services

If this event does not constitute an incident, the appropriate response is ask a user to [raise an support issue](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-platform-support/issues/new/choose) or [raise a ticket](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform/issues/new/choose) in our GitHub repository, however if the issue is security related, it is [raised here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytical-platform-ithc-2024/issues/new?template=Blank+issue).

Once you are confident that you have an incident, declare it as such.

## 2. Declare the incident
> Declaring an incident begins with updating Analytical Platform [external status page](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/external-status-dashboard/P1E3FLK/incidents/create_incident).

You will be presented with a form for you to complete:
![Create a new PagerDuty incident](./updating-external-status-page.png)

**Impacted Service** - choose all that apply from the following depending on the type of incident:

 - Cloud Platform
 - Modernisation Platform
 - Analytical Platform Ingestion
 - Analytical Platform Storage
 - Analytical Platform Compute
 - Analytical Platform Networking
 - Analytical Platform Identity

#### Which Impact to assign?

| **Impact** | Description |
|---|---|
|Major|The whole platform is down or unavailable, all user applications are unavailable|
|Minor|Part of the platform is down or unavailable, some user applications are impacted or unavailable|
|All Good|Incident has been resolved, all service is restored|

Select `Time till Next Update`. Note that users should be kept regularly updated especially during major outages, and choose accordingly.

Tick the **Send update notifications to subscribers** box.

Click **Post** button once you are happy with the form. This will update the external page. The PagerDuty Status Page slack integration will then automatically post the status in the [analytical-platform-support](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C4PF7QAJZ) and [ask-data-engineering](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C8X3PP1TN) channels.

## 3. Managing an Incident

Incident communications must be maintained in a single Slack thread in the main [analytical-platform](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04M8224WCV) team channel for maximum visibility.

### 3.1 Starting a Thread

Incident Slack thread should have a clear starting message and a thread emoji to ensure consistency. Ex: "Airflow Autoscaling Incident :thread:"

### 3.2 Capturing notes

Please note, communications in the Slack thread could later be used to reconstruct the timeline for post-incident report (if required) therefore it is critical to keep all comms to the single incident thread.

> Regular updates to the external status page should be posted to allow stakeholder visibility.

## 4. Fix the problem

Please bear in mind that not every incident requires the whole team to be involved (even if they all *want* to join in).

Log a support ticket if necessary.

If the incident cannot be resolved within the team or if the issue lies with a third-party, log a support ticket with the third-party.

For AWS support, log a call in the AWS account affected.

3rd Party | How to log a support ticket | Escalation process
---|---|---
AWS| [Creating a support case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html)| On the case, or post in [#ext-aws] (https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C015UBQ78MR)

## 5. End the incident

The incident is resolved once the user is no longer facing issues.  This may be a temporary fix, in which case an issue should be created to put a permanent fix in place.

Update the external PagerDuty status page with the resolution.

This marks the official end of the incident.

## 6. Post-incident procedure

After the incident is resolved:

* A new incident report should be created. The notes generated during the incident management in Slack can be used for the incident timeline records.
* A blameless post mortem meeting should be scheduled to identify any processes that need to be improved
* A [runbook] for how to fix this issue **should** be published
