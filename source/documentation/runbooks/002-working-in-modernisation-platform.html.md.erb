# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Analytical Platform makes use of the Modernisation Platform as a hosting solution for some of its services (e.g. [analytical-platform-ingestion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/analytical-platform-ingestion)). As such, it is important to understand how to develop solutions effectively in this context.

## Running Terraform in Modernisation Platform

> In this case we will use the [analytical-platform-ingestion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/analytical-platform-ingestion) environment.

1. Clone the [modernisation-platform-environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments) repository and open it in Visual Studio Code.

1. Start the Dev Container. `Cmd + Shift + P` -> `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
1. Navigate to the environment you are operating in - `cd terraform/environments/analytical-platform-ingestion`.
1. To run a `terraform init` + `terraform plan` run the following command:

    ``` bash
    $ bash /workspaces/modernisation-platform-environments/scripts/member-local-plan.sh

    Account: analytical-platform-ingestion
    Stage: development
    Role: modernisation-platform-sandbox

    Verify this code in your browser: ABCD-EFGH
    Please open the following URL in your browser:

    https://device.sso.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/?user_code=ABCD-EFGH
    ```

1. Click on the link provided and authorise AWS in the browser. Return to your terminal.
1. You can now run this command repeatedly with a fast feedback loop to understand the changes you are making in Terraform.

### Common Errors

If you run the `member-local-plan.sh` script and produce the error:

```
FATAL   Error running command: Invalid --profile analytical-platform-ingestion-development:modernisation-platform-developer
```
Then you need to use the `-r` flag in the `member-local-plan.sh` script:

```
$ bash /workspaces/modernisation-platform-environments/scripts/member-local-plan.sh -r modernisation-platform-sandbox
```

Modernisation Platform Environments repository has a different deployment process from the main Analytical Platform repository. 
You need to grant explicit approval for deployment to all environments.
> Remember: Just because you merged it, doesn't mean you deployed it!
