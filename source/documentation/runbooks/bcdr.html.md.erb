## Overview

This document outlines the business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) processes for the Analytical Platform, as well as our appetite for risk in relation to the uptime and recoverability of the service.

## Steps to take

If an incident which requires full or partial platform recovery occurs, follow these steps:

- Communicate the issue - see the [section below](#communication-plan)
- Identify the cause
- Agree on recovery action(s)
- Update communications
- Perform recovery actions (or monitor external incident sources - see below)
- Verify that operations are restored
- Update communications
- Perform a post-incident review, identify actions and update runbooks if applicable (this can be done later)

### Issues with underlying platforms

If the cause is identified as being an incident or issue with Modernisation Platform (or Cloud Platform for user-deployed apps) then recovery will largely be out of the hands of this team. Monitor the [#ask-moderinsation-platform] (or [#ask-cloud-platform]) channel and [relay any relevant information](#communication-plan) to users.

If the issue is with underlying AWS infrastructure (an AWS outage) then monitor the relevant AWS incident page and relay information as above.

Once the underlying issue is resolved, perform manual checks of the availability of AP services before communicating the resolution to users.

## Communication plan

- **Internal Communication**:
  - Notify the Analytical Platform team immediately when a incident is identified via the [#analytical-platform] Slack channel.
  - Create an incident thread in the above channel and tag the team using the `@analytical-platform-team` tag (not `@here` or `@channel`)
- **External Communication**:
  - Inform users about any relevant service disruptions via the [#ask-analytical-plaform] Slack channel and user groups such as the #ask-data-engineering Slack channel or DEDS email group.

## Business appetite for time to recovery

While we offer 24/7 availability, the Analytical Platform is delivered as a "business hours" service - we do not offer out of hours support. In that context, we do not currently consider the platform **as a whole** to be a business-critical service, in the same way as strategic hosting or core case management applications would be. However we are aware that certain user-developed processes and apps on the AP *may* be considered business critical.

Consequently, our target recovery time for platform unavailability is **three working days**.

### Consequences of platform unavailability

- Potential delays to published statistics
  - The outputs (ODS / CSV) for these will generally have been generated ahead of publication date for signoff and scheduling purposes
- Potential delays in answering PQs or FOI requests
  - These will generally have a reasonable SLA for turnaround
- Potential delays to internal publications such as departmental dashboards, prison or probation performance packs
- Delays to data updates of user-deployed apps (R-Shiny), or consequential downtime for those apps
- Delays to data processing for onward consumption by other services
- Faults in applications dependent on platform-hosted APIs (for example LLMs)

### Data loss

In general data is owned by users of the platform, and we do not currently back up or replicate user data held in S3 buckets. In the event of data loss, data must be re-ingested or re-uploaded from the original sources.

We rely on the reliability of AWS S3 standard storage:

- Backed with the [Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/).
- Designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
- S3 Standard (... etc.) are all designed to sustain data in the event of the loss of an entire Amazon S3 Availability Zone.

([Source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DataDurability.html))

Given the above we do not consider it cost effective to replicate or otherwise back up petabytes of data.

We do not guarantee protection against accidental deletion or modification of data by users. Accidental deletion does not contitute an incident or disaster in the context of this documument.

### Audit log loss

*this is potentally a big one*

### Platform recovery

All infrastructure is defined in code, with the core of the platform being defined in the Modernisation Platform environments repository:

- [Common](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/analytical-platform-common)
- [Compute](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/analytical-platform-compute)
- [Ingestion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/analytical-platform-ingestion)

Disaster recovery is effectively re-running infrastructure as code to recreate the AWS resources which comprise the platform.

### Data access

*Data engineering data access repo can re-create project access, but the S3 paths could be different. IAM ARNS?*

### Register My Data

*Re-create - as above; paths and IAM roles ARNs could change*

### Airflow and managed pipelines

*Something here from JHP*

Rebuild from [airflow-repo]

### Create a Derived Table (CaDeT)

[CaDeT] is based on [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) where all workflows and derived data defintions are defined in code. Once source data has been re-ingested the models can be updated to reflect any changed S3 paths and IAM role ARNs and re-run.

### Tooling

*Recovery of CP and tooling - tooling will be rebuilt as part of the infrastructre; CP re-deployed from its GHA*

*CP RDS?*
