[Wardley maps](https://www.wardleymaps.com/) offer a visual framework to understand and plan the evolution of the Analytical Platform. They help map out system components, their dependencies, and their maturity, empowering teams to:

- Evaluate whether to use off-the-shelf tools or build bespoke solutions
- Anticipate future trends in analytics and optimise for upcoming needs
- Focus on evolving high-value components and commoditise lower-value ones
- Understand relationships between data sources, processing tools, and applications
- Mapping the Analytical Platform through different user lenses helps us focus on delivering value where it matters most

## Maps by User Role
