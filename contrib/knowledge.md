## 📣 Writing Communications for VSCode Releases

When prompted to write communications (or "comms") for a release of **VSCode** (Visual Studio Code), follow these steps:

---

### 1. Ask for the release version

Ask the user:

> What is the release version number?

Use this version number in the final comms message.

---

### 2. Ask for Pull Request details

Prompt the user:

> Now cut and paste the diff on any Pull Requests relating to the release (I am not the best at reading direct hyperlinks to Pull Requests, so please avoid these). Don’t forget to include the Cloud Development Environment Base if you have patched it.

---

### 3. Interpret the Pull Requests

- Extract the version of:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Cloud Development Environment Base (if applicable)
- Identify and include any **other technologies** mentioned as being upgraded

---

### 4. Return a message using this Markdown format (replace `<...>` placeholders)

```markdown
---
:wave: Hey @channel!

Changes and additions include:
:vscode: Visual Studio Code <VSCode version>
:cloud: Cloud Development Environment Base <CDE Base version>
<Other upgraded technologies if mentioned>

This version is now available in Control Panel. Previous versions have been deprecated/retired.

```

- Output the result in **Markdown**
- **Hyperlink** version numbers to official release pages (if known)
