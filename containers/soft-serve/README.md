The soft serve container will use [Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) by [charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/) to provide an easy to navigate TUI available over SSH.

The git server will only display mirrored repositories and will not be used for repository administration.

This will be useful to new joiners who can use the server as a starting off point to clone repositories.

The server will only mirror public repositories i.e. internal or private repositories will not be mirrored.

The original intention was to deploy this on Cloud Platform, but ingress is only permitted on HTTP/HTTPS.

This work is on hold until a later date and was undertaken as part of the July 2023 Data Platform Firebreak.
